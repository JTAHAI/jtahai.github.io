# Justin Tahai

Systems engineer. Builder of durable, accessible, low-friction infrastructure.

This site is a lightweight notebook: how I design, reason about, and maintain systems over time — without hype.

## Where to find me
- Personal profile hub: **https://justintahai.pages.dev**
- Web services: **https://tahai.jtforme.com**
- LinkedIn (primary): **https://www.linkedin.com/in/justintahai/**

## Examples (static-first in practice)
- **Campaign / public information**: fast, readable pages + sources and references.
- **Movement / org site**: clear navigation, accessible content, minimal runtime risk.
- **Documentation**: searchable, versioned knowledge base that’s easy to hand off.

## What I’m optimizing for
- **Durability** over novelty
- **Accessibility** as a default
- **Performance** without tricks
- **Security** by reducing attack surface
- **Clean handoff** (no vendor lock‑in)
