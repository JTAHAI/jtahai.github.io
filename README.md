# jtahai.github.io (recommended)

This repo hosts my GitHub Pages site: systems notes, checklists, and short essays on durable, accessible, static-first engineering.

## Fixing the URL

Right now, GitHub is publishing this as a **project site**, which produces a URL like:

```
https://jtahai.github.io/justintahai.github.io/
```

If you want the clean personal URL...

## Local preview (optional)
If you have Ruby + Bundler:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Otherwise, edit the markdown files and push — GitHub Pages will build it.
