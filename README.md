## About this site

This repository powers **https://jtahai.github.io** — a static-first notebook where I write about:

- Durable system design
- Accessibility as a default
- Performance without tricks
- Security via reduced attack surface
- Clean handoff and long-term maintainability

It complements my primary profile site at  
👉 https://justintahai.jtforme.com

That site provides broader professional and civic context; this one stays intentionally technical and documentation-focused.
